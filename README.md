## Hi there 👋
🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development at Franklin University.

🙈 I have been working in this field for 8 years and still feel that there is so much to learn.

🥸 I know there are people out there who are smarter and better at this than I am but I still want to learn and grow.

✉️ Feel free to check out the repos I have, reach out to me at avswain91@gmail.com.
